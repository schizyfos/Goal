"The discovery of the notion of computability constituted a new approach to discovering truths about the world. The logician Kurt Gödel generously acknowledged that computability theory has for the first time succeeded in giving an absolute definition of an interesting epistemological notion, i. e., one not depending on the formalism chosen. What can be computed does not change as one varies the details of the model."

"Why do you think, Socrates, that this method of thinking and arguing can be used only for the study of numbers and geometric forms? Why do you not try to convince your fellow-citizens to apply the same high logical standards in every other field, for instance in philosophy and politics; in discussing the problems of everyday private and public life?" From that time, this is what I have always tried to do".
